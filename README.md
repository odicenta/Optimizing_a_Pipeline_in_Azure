# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The best performing model was found after studying how a classical approach using scikit-learn regression can be compared versus the different options available in Azure ML. 
To be able to compare the different approachs, the metric used to compare was the accuracy of the model, with the following results:
 - For the scikit-learn model, the accuracy was 91.17%
 - For the Hyperparameter tuning, where the Regularization strength was allowed to be randomly selected from a uniform distribution of (0.01 to 0.99), the accuracy was 91.4%, or slightly better than for the scikit.
 - Finally, by allowing Azure to use AutoML to select the best model and run, we were able to increase the accuracy to 91.5%. In this case, the model MaxAbsScaler, LightGBM was selected by Azure as the best performing. 

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
